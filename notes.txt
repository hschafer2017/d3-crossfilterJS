SVG - scalable vector graphics
SVG tags create an SVG viewport 
for SVG, (x = 0, y= 0) is in the top left, not the bottom left as on a traditional graph. 
to make a color, use a 'fill' in the tag, to add a border, use stroke = "color" stroke-width = "1"
to make the graph upright, you have to take the height of the tallest one, subtracted by the height of that bar, that is your new y value. 

domain is the max value you have in the data set
